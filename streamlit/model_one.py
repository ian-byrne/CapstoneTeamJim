*  Granularity: county level is the smallest available location type available across this dataset.
*  Lack of monthly data availability, unlike the other two models. This is due to data availability of ACS demographic data.
*  Feature importances are all positive, meaning we cannot discern whether a feature has a negative or positive correlation with the outcome variable.

*  As years go by the availability of demographic data will increase. This model clearly shows the importance of some of these features. Even if we could not gather current demographic data, with a longer history we could build a regression model to predict more than 1 year ahead, making predictions into the future possible. This would be a useful tool for investors and individuals in the market for a home.
*  Incorporate ensemble models to boost prediction strength.
